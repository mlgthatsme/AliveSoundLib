Sound library for the open source implementation of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee and Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus which can be found here: https://github.com/paulsapps/alive/

The goal for this library is to have an audio library that plays the music and sound fx from the first 2 classic Oddworld titles. With things such as added reverb, a customizable equalizer, and user friendly modding in mind.
